# Code Standards

Each project defines its standards based on its own constraints.
These are solution wide rules of thumbs.

## Rules Of Thumb

- Use C89 - unless good reason todo otherwise. 
- KEEP IT VANILLA AS FUCK - unless good reason todo otherwise.
- Trunk based development.
- Code in style set by file, or restyle the file.
