# Nil Aspects Build

Build settings for the Aspects Controllers.

## Preprocessor Flags

**NIMGUI**
Set this in the project file to disable all Imgui (and related) functionality.
This is good for profiling etc.

**NDEBUGLINES**
Set this in the project file to disable all debug lines. Debug lines aren't
designed to be fast so this could give some perf.
