# Render-O-Vision

ROV is to be a _lightweight_ mesh renderer. I may split this project up later
to have Hardware resources handled by a different library. That depends on if
I want to have post processes and particles handled here or not.

## Design Goals

- Simple API
- Submit Per frame API

## Technical Goals

- Mesh Rendering
- Screenspace effects
- Some debug helpers
- Simple lighting
