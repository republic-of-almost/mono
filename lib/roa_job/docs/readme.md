# ROA Job Readme

Optio is my task solution, based on fibers, its writen in C++11 and uses Boost
for the asm it should be very portable.

## Current State

This is only an inital implimentation while I make sure it a) works and b) works
on the platforms I want. There is a lot of optimizations that can happen to speed
this up.
