### Delete Data

You should be able to delete data without having to destroy the node.


### Delete Resources

We should be able to delte a resource.


### Resource Lifetime

We need to be sure this is working.


### Transforms / Other Nested Data

Transforms should be treated more like other data and have the graph only deal
with relationships.

This would allow us to add other inherited data like BHV's for example.


### Last Used Resource

Last used on resources would allow us to be able make better choices later down
the line. Ie dump a high res texture in favour of a low res one etc.


### Hash Strings

The string lookup for names and stuff is bad and should be removed.


### Move A Resource

We should be able to avoid excessive copying of textures like we do.
